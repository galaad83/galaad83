        The Blue Lagoon
    </h1>
     <p>
        Iceland is known for its many hot springs, and the Blue Lagoon is the most popular of them all. Its milky-blue water is caused by an abundance of silica which forms the iconic white mud at the bottom of the pool. And its unique color stands out even more thanks to the surrounding black lava field.

        Pamukkale
    </h1>   
     <p>
        Denizli Province in southwestern Turkey is home to a stunning site called Pamukkale. The beauty of the landscape is created by a collection of 17 terraced basins between two and 20 feet high. When water pours over the edge of each basin, calcite is deposited, eventually crystalizing into a form of limestone called travertine. This is what gives Pamukkale its appearance of sparkling white cascades of stone, and also what inspired its name, which translates to "cotton castle."
